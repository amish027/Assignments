Build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using Python.
There are two datasets which are shared - 
1. Delivery Time 
	Objective  - Is to predict the Delivery time using Sorting time
1. Follow the Machine Learning Life Cycle Steps.
2. Write proper Insights/Inference on each analysis
3. Do proper EDA on the columns and the data with graphs using seaborn and interpret the graphs.
4. Save the graphs in one folder and zip the folder.

5. Save the Code and download it as .ipynb format - with its name "Delivery_prj1"
